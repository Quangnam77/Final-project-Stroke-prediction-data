📈Insight of models: Power Bi

Get the details of the relationship of 5 main factors: age, bmi, avg_glucose, heart_disease and hypertension

Age: Old is the most group have the highest ratio of stroke patent
While Bmi is Overweight and avg_glucose_level is Diabetes.

📈 **Models**

The notebook includes the following models:

Logistic Regression: to determine the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable

Random Forest: To calculate the accuracy of database


📝 **Report**

The detailed methodology and results are described in the Power Bi, google colab and presentation
